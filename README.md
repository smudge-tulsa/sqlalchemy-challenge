# sqlalchemy-challenge
TCC DA bootcamp challenge

This challenge had a notional scenario: a vacation to Hawaii. Honolulu weather station measurement data was provided and students were tasked with using Python and common libraries to determine stats for the busiest weather monitoring station and execute API calls to plan vacation travel routes accordingly.

climate_starter.ipynb contains the Jupyter Notebook with Python code utilizing SQLAlchemy, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze Honolulu's weather data (precipitation and observed temps).

app.py contains the starter shell for Flask API-based air travel routes. This code was not completed.
